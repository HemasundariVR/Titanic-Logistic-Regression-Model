### Project Name : Logistic Regression Model

### Softwares used :
Data Pre-Processing - jupyter book - Pandas - Seaborn
Logistic Regression Model - Training and Testing - R Studio
Data Source - www.kaggle.com/datasets

### Description :
Initially, from (www.kaggle.com/datasets), I downloaded two csv files namely tit_train.csv and tit_test.csv and I merged both into a single dataframe and done my data pre-processing with the help of Pandas in Jupyter book and saved the cleaned data as titanic_data_Cleaned.csv. Further I fitted the logistic regression model for 70 % training data for the response("Survived") and Tested for remaining 30% test data.Now I Calculated accuracy by confusion matrix and got Accuracy : 0.888 and 95% CI on Accuracy : (0.8526, 0.9175)
